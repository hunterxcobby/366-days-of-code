     - Valid input values for normal integer division.
     - Division by zero scenario.
     - Invalid input values causing a `ValueError`.
   - Ensured that the script behaves as expected and handles exceptions gracefully.

4. **Refining the Solution:**
   - Reviewed the code to ensure readability and adherence to best practices.
   - Encapsulated the script logic inside functions for modularity.

5. **Documentation:**
