**Today's Progress**: Web Infrastructure design - DNS, HTTPS/HTTP, SPOF, Firewalls

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF) in Systems:**
   - Defined SPOF as a non-redundant component that, if dysfunctional, can cause system failure.
   - learned the implications of SPOFs in various systems and the importance of redundancy for high availability.

2. **Eliminating Single Points of Failure:**
   - Outlined steps to identify and eliminate SPOFs, including risk assessments and achieving redundancy.
   - discovered redundancy at the internal component, system, and site levels for robust protection.

3. **HTTP vs. HTTPS:**
   - learned the secure version of HTTP, HTTPS, highlighting its role in encrypting data between browsers and websites.
   - Pointed out the visual indicators in browsers for HTTPS connections.

4. **How HTTPS Works and HTTPS Certificate:**
   - Detailed the use of SSL/TLS protocols in encrypting communications for HTTPS.
   - Explained the role of HTTPS certificates in establishing secure sessions.

5. **Benefits of HTTPS:**
   - Highlighted the encryption of customer information and the trust-building aspects of HTTPS.

6. **History, Types, and Benefits of Firewalls:**
   - Traced the history of firewalls from physical barriers to network security tools.
   - Differentiated between hardware and software firewalls, outlining their purposes and applications.
   - learned the benefits and limitations of firewalls as essential network security measures.

7. **Types of Firewalls:**
    - Covered various firewall types, including packet filtering, proxy, NAT, cloud, stateful inspection, UTM, network segmentation, and next-generation firewalls.

8. **Evolution Beyond Firewalls: Zero Trust and XDR:**
    - Acknowledged the limitations of traditional firewalls.
    - zero trust architectures, microsegmentation, and extended detection and response (XDR) as evolving security paradigms.

9. **Top Next-Generation Firewall Vendors:**
    - key next-gen firewall vendors, including Palo Alto, Check Point, Cisco, Fortinet, Juniper Networks, and Sophos.

10. **Other Firewall Vendors:**
    - Learned additional firewall vendors, offering a diverse range of security solutions.

11. **National Firewalls and the Great Firewall of China:**
    - learned the use of firewalls for content control in nations, focusing on China's Great Firewall.
    - Described techniques such as IP address blocking, DNS cache poisoning, and VPN restrictions employed in the Great Firewall.

12. **Overall Progress:**
    - Covered a wide array of topics, from foundational concepts like DNS and HTTPS to advanced topics like firewalls and network security paradigms.
